# MyGroceriesList
Making my groceries easier. My usual recipes are hardcoded into the website, and I can add unexpected ingredients manually. At the bottom one can toggle between recipes and ingredients.

Adding a recipe requires changes in two places: in the HTML and in the Javascript files. I don't know a more concise way, but I rarely add recipes anyway.
